	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command

	powerCmd.PersistentFlags().String("type", "", "on/off")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// powerCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
